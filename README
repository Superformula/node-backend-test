beginnings of an api...

the main focus here has been around testing...

the api endpoints:
GET     /
GET     /v1/users
GET     /v1/users/:id
POST    /v1/users
PUT     /v1/users/:id
DELETE  /v1/users/:id

Options to start the app:
1. run dynamo locally and just:
    > npm i && node.app
2. docker-compose up

Options to test the app
1. if running dynamo and the app locally:
    > npm run test ./models/*spec* ./*spec*
2. if looking to run them through docker:
    > ./test.sh
3. if you want to run some curl tests when the app is up, you can:
    > ./test_with_curl

Some highlights:
    - the user model tests against a local dynamo instance
    - each test starts with a clean db to help isolate each test case
    - a coverage report is available using nyc
    - some ideas for how metrics and logging might work are included in comments
    - a basic circle ci config is present but not tested

A few ideas that sprang up while coding have been jotted down in todo/

Some of the environment setup around local dynamo is a little wonky.
I imagine it would need a second pass when considering ecs.

Thanks for your time; was very cool meeting you all.
