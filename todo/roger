1. improve tests on metrics, checks args being passed
2. user delete should probably be soft deletes... check with codin.
3. remove root request handler and create a somewhat obfuscated /health endpoint
   (all other paths should be authorized and include user/client information irl);
4. send all app errors through the logger.
5. ensure POST method does not allow createdAt property.
6. dynamo scans can be parallel with TotalSegments arg irl.
7. implement elastic search for search and paginated results irl.
8. for the advanced "filter feature".. are we basically
   talking a get all and filter(record => record.name === whatever)?
   or are we thinking more like an elastic search query?
   the latter might look something like:
   {
    query: {
      match:{
       name:'term'
      }
     }
   }
