1. improve tests on metrics, checks args being passed
2. user delete should probably be soft deletes... check with codin.
3. remove root request handler and create a somewhat obfuscated health endpoint
   (all other paths should be authorized and include user/client information);
4. send all app errors through the logger.
5. ensure POST method does not allow createdAt property
6. implement elastic search.
